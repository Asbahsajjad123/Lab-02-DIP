Task 02: Use an image and apply CC labelling for counting of objects and display total number of objects.
# Code Explanation
This code performs object detection and counting in an image using OpenCV and Python. First, the required libraries are installed and the image is uploaded in Google Colab. The image is read and converted from BGR to RGB for proper display, then converted into grayscale to simplify processing. Otsu’s thresholding is applied to convert the grayscale image into a binary image, and the colors are inverted so that objects appear white on a black background. To remove noise, morphological opening is used, which eliminates small unwanted white pixels. After that, connected component analysis is applied to detect individual objects, and very small components are removed based on a minimum area threshold so that only meaningful objects remain. The remaining objects are counted and assigned unique labels, which are then visualized using different colors. Finally, the code displays the original image, the binary image before noise removal, the cleaned binary image, and the final colored labeled components, along with the total number of detected objects.
